I am a self-taught programmer with a strong passion for coding and database analysis.I love the freedom that writing programs gives me. I am constantly looking for new solutions to become a better person and programmer. <img align="right" alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/ellarekow/ellarekow/blob/main/ellarekowgif" width="408" height="318" />

I haven't had the opportunity to work in IT yet, but I'm still growing and writing more and more complex software. My dream is to find a job in big tech so I can spread my wings and work with the best!

I am improving my skills in Python and SQL (PostgreSQL)
