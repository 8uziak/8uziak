Happy to see you here!

I am a self-taught programmer with a strong passion for coding and database analysis.I love the freedom that writing programs gives me. I am constantly looking for new solutions to become a better person and programmer.

I haven't had the opportunity to work in IT yet, but I'm still growing and writing more and more complex software. My dream is to find a job in big tech so I can spread my wings and work with the best!

I am improving my skills in Python and SQL (PostgreSQL)

👨🏻‍ Please feel free to get in touch, I'll be happy to help!
